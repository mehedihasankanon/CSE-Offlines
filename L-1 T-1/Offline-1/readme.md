## Problem 1: Statistical Analysis

Implement a statistical analysis tool that allows the user to enter multiple numbers and then
perform various statistical operations on the data.

### Operations:

1. Find Maximum and Minimum Numbers
2. Calculate the Average
3. Count Even and Odd Numbers
4. Sum of All Numbers

### Detailed Instructions:

● First, allow the user to enter multiple numbers. You can ask the user how many
numbers they wish to input, and then use a loop to collect those numbers.
● After collecting the numbers, display maximum number, minimum number, sum of all
numbers, average, even number count and odd number count.

### Example Scenario:

```
How many numbers do you want to enter? 5
Enter 5 numbers: 10 15 25 30 40
Minimum Number: 10
Maximum Number:40
Sum of all Numbers: 120
Average: 24
Even Number Count: 3
Odd Number Count: 2
```

## Problem 2: Pattern Generation
